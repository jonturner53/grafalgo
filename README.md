# grafalgo
Grafalgo is a library of graph algorithms and associated data structures.  It was originally created to support a graduate course in advanced data structures and algorithms at Washington University. Consequently, it includes a variety of
different algorithms for various problems. The code is highly efficient, but includes only minimal error checking (and mostly in the form of assertion macros that can be disabled). If you choose to use it in a production setting, you are advised to study the code carefully to make sure it is suitable for your purpose.

Grafalgo was originally written in C++. However, a Javascript version has also been developed
and is currently the main focus of activity. The two provide similar functionality but
there has been no attempt to keep them fully consistent.
There is also the beginnings of a Java version, but it is very much on the back burner.
