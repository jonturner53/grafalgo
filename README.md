# grafalgo
Grafalgo is a library of graph algorithms and associated data structures.  It was originally created to support a graduate course in advanced data structures and algorithms at Washington University. Consequently, it includes a variety of
different algorithms for various problems. The code is highly efficient, but includes only minimal error checking (and mostly in the form of assertion macros that can be disabled). If you choose to use it in a production setting, you are advised to study the code carefully to make sure it is suitable for your purpose.
<p>
Grafalgo was originally written in C++ and that remains the primary version. However, java and javascript versions are being developed. Still, very much a work-in-progress.
